Predictive Analytics with Machine Learning

1)Data Preprocessing for ML
==========================
Cleaning missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

Example: Standardizing customer income data before predicting churn.


2)Train-Test Split
===================
Splitting data into training (to build the model) and testing (to evaluate performance).

Example: 80% training, 20% testing split.


3)Logistic Regression for Prediction
====================================
A statistical model for binary outcomes (Yes/No, True/False).

Example: Predicting whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.


4)Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
=======================================================
Accuracy shows overall correctness.
Precision shows true positives among predicted positives.
Recall shows true positives among actual positives.
F1-score balances precision and recall.


5)Case Study â€“ Customer Churn Prediction
=======================================
Using customer data (age, usage, billing, support tickets) to predict churn likelihood.

Key takeaway: Predictive models help businesses act proactively.
